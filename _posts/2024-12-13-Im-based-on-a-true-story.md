 Art is rooted in my true passion. At times, it's difficult to articulate, but I’ve found it’s better to let it flow naturally. When I first considered art journaling, I thought it would be challenging to find freedom in my writing. Yet, to my surprise, it came effortlessly—almost as if I’d been waiting for this moment.  

Through this process, I’ve realized that fine art has made me more thoughtful and introspective. Before creating any piece, I need to deeply reflect on where I’m coming from and what the work means to me. My art has always been about expressing myself and understanding what my journey signifies. To create authentically, I’ve had to cleanse and center myself, uncovering what I truly wanted to bring into existence, As I waned to panit all my life but felt that I need a to stable in order to do so, I felt that you'll never be really. This is my mythos to my self aa I become something I had not imaged but felt inside. ]
